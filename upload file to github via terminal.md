Certainly! You can upload your code to GitHub using the Visual Studio Code (VS Code) terminal. Here are the steps:

Initialize a Local Git Repository:
Open your project folder in VS Code.
Open the terminal within VS Code (you can use the shortcut Ctrl+<kbd>~</kbd>).
Run the following command to create a local Git repository:
git init

Commit Your Changes:
After making changes to your code, stage them for commit:
git add .

Commit the staged changes with a descriptive message:
git commit -m "Initial commit"

Create a New GitHub Repository:
Visit your GitHub account and create a new repository.
Exclude creating README.md, .gitignore, and any license files during repository creation.
Link Local Repository to GitHub:
Copy the link to your newly created GitHub repository.
Back in the VS Code terminal, run these commands:
git remote add origin <GitHub_Repo_Link>
git remote -v  # Verify the link to the remote repo
git push -u origin master  # Push your committed changes to the remote repo
